# 🔒 Ultra-Advanced Security & Penetration Testing for Fintech Application

## 📌 Overview
This project implements **enterprise-grade security** for a fintech application, ensuring **robust authentication, API security, encryption, and penetration testing**. It integrates **automated security checks into CI/CD** to enforce best security practices.

## 🚀 Features & Security Measures

### ✅ **Authentication & Access Control**
- **OAuth 2.0 / JWT Authentication** with **refresh tokens**.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for enhanced login security.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to restrict sensitive operations.

### ✅ **API & Data Security**
- **Rate Limiting, IP Whitelisting, and Request Throttling** to prevent abuse.
- **Argon2 Password Hashing** for strong encryption.
- **HTTPS & TLS 1.3** enforced for secure data transfer.

### ✅ **Application Security Hardening**
- **Input Validation & Sanitization** using **Marshmallow** (prevents SQL Injection, XSS).
- **Security Headers**: CSP, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security.
- **Secure Session Management** with expiration and secure cookies.

## 🛡️ Penetration Testing & Security Audits
- **OWASP ZAP & Burp Suite**: Identified and mitigated XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Nikto & Wapiti**: Scanned for outdated dependencies and security misconfigurations.
- **SonarQube Static Code Analysis**: Ensured secure coding practices.
- **Final Penetration Testing** before deployment.

## 🔄 CI/CD Security Integration
- **GitHub Actions** for automated security scans.
- **OWASP Dependency-Check** for detecting outdated libraries.
- **Trivy Container Scanning** for Docker image vulnerabilities.
- **Terraform Infrastructure as Code** for secure deployment.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Provisioning
- **Dockerized Backend & Frontend** with multi-stage builds.
- **Kubernetes Deployment** with **RBAC & Pod Security Policies**.
- **Helm Charts** for secure app deployment.
